Why now this part in my life, watching the Internship and The Intern why can't I do it also. Then I been watching Tomorrowland, Meet the Robinsons and Big Hero 6 a key element from each movie repeating in my head especially "WHEN are you gonna start doing something with that big brain of yours?". Here goes nothing enjoy have fun and I will entertain to the best of my ability I am not a designer by trade, I don't draw unless it is a stick figure.
